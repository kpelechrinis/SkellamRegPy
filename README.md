# SkellamRegPy

In this repository you will find a jupyter notebook with some basic script/code for training a Skellam regression using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. 

In the future the goal is to transform this to an actual library that will be able to learn a Skellam regression model (and potentially other Generalized Linear Models beyond the ones already available in existing libraries) without the need to specify the actual maximum likelihood function as of now.
